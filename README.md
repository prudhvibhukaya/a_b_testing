This project investigates how product performance can be improved through data-driven analysis of customer behavior and targeted marketing strategies.
It combines literature research, empirical data collection (surveys, interviews), and statistical & machine learning techniques to deliver actionable recommendations for businesses.

The analysis identifies key KPIs that influence customer retention, engagement, and satisfaction, and applies A/B testing and behavioral segmentation to optimize product features and marketing campaigns. Results indicate that focusing on UX quality and customer satisfaction significantly improves retention rates, while behavior-based targeting enhances conversion efficiency.

The study concludes with a scalable framework for integrating customer analytics into decision-making processes, enabling companies to boost ROI, reduce churn, and align product development with user needs.
